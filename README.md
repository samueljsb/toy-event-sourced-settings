# toy event-sourced settings

This is a toy project for me to play with event sourcing and understand how to
put together an event-sourced system.

## getting started

In a virtual environment:

```shell
python -mpip install -rrequirements.txt
python -mmanage runserver
```

You can then add/remove/edit/view simple settings as strings.
